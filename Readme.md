â›” DEPRECATED. This example demonstrated how to change the style of a parent node's selection checkbox if some of its child nodes are selected. Starting with v11.1, ASPxTreeList can automatically highlight a parent node if some of its child nodes are selected. Set the <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.ASPxTreeList.TreeListSettingsSelection.Recursive">ASPxTreeList.SettingsSelection.Recursive</a> property to `True` to activate it. 

You can try this functionality in theÂ following online demo:
